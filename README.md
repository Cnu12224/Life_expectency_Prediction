# 🌍 Life Expectancy Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts a country's life expectancy using various indicators such as immunization rates, disease prevalence, GDP, and healthcare access. It applies regression techniques to understand the relationship between these factors and life expectancy.

## 🔍 Features

- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding, normalization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature correlation and multicollinearity analysis
- Model training using Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Performance evaluation using R² score, RMSE

## 📚 Dataset

- Source: [WHO Life Expectancy Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
- Includes health, demographic, and economic indicators across countries and years

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
